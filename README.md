# Bamazon

Bamazon is a node app using MySQL and node.js to create online department store. Users can buy items or view stock, restock, or view low stock depending whether they’re in customer mode or manager mode. 

					Customer Mode

The user can browse through items listed on a table and purchase them by inserting the item’s unique Id number.

Once they have done that, the app will prompt how much they would like to purchase then spit out the “receipt” stating how many were bought, the item name, and the total cost. The app goes on to prompting a “Thank you for shopping with us” quote. 


				  Manager Mode


Manager Mode allows the user to choose between four options:
* View Products for Sale
